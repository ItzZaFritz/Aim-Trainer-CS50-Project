# Aim-Trainer-CS50-Project
This Python game, built with Tkinter, challenges players to click on randomly appearing blue or red balls within a set time. The gameâ€™s difficulty can be adjusted by setting ball duration (ms) and total time (sec). Points are earned by hitting balls quickly, improving aim and reaction time.
