Constants and Global Variables: At the start of the game several constant values determine the nature of the game and its looks. WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT define the size of the window in which the game is running and BALL_RADIUS defines the size of the balls. When defining colors, we use hexadecimal values, so that during the game, balls do not mingle with each other, and their color shade difference is noticeable. Global variables regulate the game process variables such as game_running which shows if the game is active and ball_appear_time which determines the visibility time of each ball.

Game Flow: The core functionality of the game is in several functions. In start_game() game variables are set or reconfigured, the canvas is cleared, and a timer and ball display begins. It uses the root. It is necessary to use the after() method to periodically call show_ball() and update_timer(). This function is responsible for the look of balls, the color of which is set randomly and the location of which is set randomly, and mouse click events are linked to it.

Timer and Ball Management: The update_timer() function on its part erases the display and reduces the value of the game timer. They both use recursive calls to root in their work. after() to update the timer every second and pause the game when the timer is out. The show_ball() function controls the ballâ€™s appearance and is dependent on the time passed since the last ball was shown. The ball is set randomly on the arena and can be either black or white The function also redraws the ball while the game is still on.

User Interaction: The interaction of the user is managed by the hit_ball() function that increases the score and initiates the appearance of a new ball when any of them is clicked. This function also regulates when the ball has to reappear on the screen to increase the level of the game. The last one, end_game(), is set to be called when the timer is up, it then shows the score and pauses the game by freezing the updates and button inputs.

User Interface and Design Flaw: Using the Tkinter package, the user interface is created from Canvas, Button, and Label classes. The Canvas is the principal working area of the balls whereas Labels are utilized to represent the timer and the score. The Button initiates the game, according to the features, and users can play it. At first, the idea was to use different UI pages for setting up games, which can make the configuration itself much more versatile. However, since the management of multiple UI pages in Tkinter is somewhat problematic, it was decided to include settings before the start of the game through input prompts. This approach de-clutters the interface and also makes it possible for the users to set their preferences without more complications.
